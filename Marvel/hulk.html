					<h1>The Incredible Hulk</h1>
					<p>The Hulk (real name Bruce Banner) is one of the first six founding members of the Avengers. An exposure to gamma radiation turned the scientist into the powerhouse brute.<br><br>

					While attempting to save a friend's life, Bruce Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and transformed into a monstrosity, the Hulk. After the transformation, his skin was changed to a green color, and his hair turned black. The muscle enhancement gained from his transformation gave him an incredible spike in strength; making him the strongest individual on the planet.<br><br>

					At some point, the Hulk joined the Avengers; a group of superheroes intent on protecting the world. After some time though, the Avengers disbanded for reasons unknown leaving the Hulk and the other members to go their separate ways.<br><br>

					In Adapting to Change, Hulk is shown to have transformed back into Bruce Banner. This is because in the movies, Bruce was able to transform into the Hulk and back to human form.<br><br>

					In Ultron Revolution Hulk's pants are dark purple in back and front with two light purple stripes along the sides and the red Avengers logo with a sliver symbol. Hulk is wears specially designed Avengers pants that can stretch to fit him. The material of which was shown to be extremely durable on several occasions. Bruce Banner turned back into Hulk with his pants still intact.<br><br>

					Hulk is short-tempered and aggressive, but not mean spirited. He can be a sore loser at times. But he also has a friendly side. He has an impressive level of control over his strength. He also has an enormous appetite as befits someone of his strength. Hulk is also intelligent enough to come up with good plans or find a missing teammate.<br><br>

					Bruce Banner is intelligent, calm, friendly, level-headed, headstrong, sometimes timid and impatience. Direct opposite to his alter ego. He once refused to become Hulk in episode "Dehulked" but later excepted his destiny to remain as Hulk as a means of his own protection.</p>
